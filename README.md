# Hospital Management System: SQL Data Analysis Projec
This project contains a comprehensive set of 22 analytical SQL queries designed to extract key performance indicators (KPIs) and business insights from a relational database schema modeling a hospital or clinic management system.The project demonstrates proficiency in essential SQL concepts including complex joins, aggregation (SUM, AVG, COUNT), ranking (ORDER BY/LIMIT), filtering (WHERE/HAVING), and Common Table Expressions (CTEs).🎯 Project Goal and Key InsightsThe primary goal is to provide operational and strategic analysis for hospital administrators by answering critical questions about doctor performance, patient engagement, and financial health.Top 5 Business Questions Answered:Revenue by Doctor (KPI): Total revenue generated by each physician, linking billing to the treatment and the responsible doctor. (Query 8)Doctor Performance: Identify the Top 3 doctors based on the total number of unique patients treated. (Query 18)Financial Health: Revenue breakdown by payment status (paid, pending) and total amount collected per payment method. (Queries 5, 17)Patient Engagement: Identify patients who have had multiple appointments, signaling high engagement or chronic care needs. (Query 16)Most Common Services: Determine the average cost and most frequently occurring treatment types. (Queries 12, 13)🗃️ Database Schema OverviewThe analysis is based on five core tables, designed to model a many-to-many relationship between patients and doctors through appointments and billing.Table NameDescriptionKey FieldsdoctorsPhysician details, specialization, and years of experience.doctor_id (PK)patientsPatient demographics, address, and insurance information.patient_id (PK)appointmentsRecords all scheduled and completed visits.appointment_id (PK), patient_id (FK), doctor_id (FK)treatmentsDetails of services provided, including treatment type and cost.treatment_id (PK), appointment_id (FK)billingFinancial records, amount, payment status (paid/pending), and method.bill_id (PK), patient_id (FK), treatment_id (FK)🔍 Examples of Advanced Queries1. Total Revenue Generated by Each Doctor (Query 8)This query requires joining four tables (doctors, appointments, treatments, billing) to accurately attribute revenue to the responsible doctor.SQLSELECT 
    d.doctor_id, 
    CONCAT(d.first_name, ' ', d.last_name) AS doctor_name, 
    ROUND(SUM(b.amount), 2) AS total_revenue 
FROM doctors d 
JOIN appointments a ON d.doctor_id = a.doctor_id
JOIN treatments t ON a.appointment_id = t.appointment_id
JOIN billing b ON t.treatment_id = b.treatment_id
GROUP BY d.doctor_id, doctor_name
ORDER BY d.doctor_id;
